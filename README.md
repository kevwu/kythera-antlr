# kythera

An interpreter for a new programming language, spurred on by a particularly fruitless and frustrating coding session with Go.

`kythera` is named after the [Antikythera mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism). I picked this name 
because it evokes an image of ancient machinery and sounds cool. As most programming languages never go beyond 
personal exploration, I consider this to be a major feature of the language.
